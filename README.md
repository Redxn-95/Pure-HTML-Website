# Pure HTML Website.

[HTML Website](https://redxn-95.github.io/Pure-HTML-Website/)

** Travelling back to the early 90's - 2000's era of the internet, i have created a very basic multipage website
using only HTML to get to grips with the following:
- Structure & Layout
- Tables & Grids
- Inline Styles
- Working links to other pages
- Working 'Email Me' button.
